My project is a board game which consists of two players who have to find the treasure. Whoever gets to the treasure first wins the game.  
It’s a pretty straight forward game. Each player rolls the dice with a click of a button and depending on the value of the dice, the piece move forward. However, there’s a catch! If the player steps into the twilight zone, the piece moves back two steps , giving a chance to the other player to get to the treasure first.
